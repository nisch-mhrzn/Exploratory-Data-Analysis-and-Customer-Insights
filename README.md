# Project Learnings

## Overview
This project focused on performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using the insights to improve customer experience and sales.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to conduct a thorough EDA, uncovering valuable insights.
- **Improved Customer Experience**: Identified potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups, enabling better targeting and personalization.
- **Increased Sales**: Determined the most selling product categories and items, which can help plan inventory and meet customer demands more effectively.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy

## Future Improvements
- Implement a recommendation system to suggest products based on customer preferences.
- Analyze customer churn and identify ways to retain valuable customers.
- Integrate the insights into a dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision-making.
